jQuery and Bootstrap werent used in this.

This wasn't the original plan for what I wanted to do, I made a few different things but they wouldn't work or they were too complex for me. At first I was gonna make a match the colors memory game but it was too much, then I decided to try pac-man, also too much for me, then I tried to make a few different portfolio designs and didn't like any of them so now I'm here with this rushed one.
